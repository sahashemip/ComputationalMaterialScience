# Angle Dependent Raman Intensity
This repository offers a suite of tools to facilitate research and understanding in the field of Raman spectroscopy, specifically **angle dependent Raman spectrocopy**.
The author follows [**SO**LID prciples](https://realpython.com/solid-principles-python/), more percisely 2 core principles of [Single-responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) (SRP) and [Openâ€“closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle) (OCP),  for wrting a more maintainable and flexible code.
